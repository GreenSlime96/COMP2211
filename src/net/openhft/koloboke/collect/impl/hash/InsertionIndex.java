/**
 * Low-level insertion methods of open-addressing hash tables
 * should return index along with slot type:
 * 1) the same element is already present in the hash
 * 2) free slot
 * 3) "removed" slot
 *
 * There are several ways to pass this information to higher-level methods:
 *
 *   - Member boolean field + "-index - 1" hack. Allows to encode even 4 states,
 *     we need 3. Overhead: index arithmetic, 1 field IO, + 0-8 bytes to every
 *     hash table (most likely 0).
 *
 *   - "Tuple" class (this one). Overhead before escape analysis and scalarization:
 *     object allocation, 2 fields IO.
 *     After scalarization: theoretically, almost no overhead.
